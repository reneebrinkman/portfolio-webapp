# portfolio-webapp

This is a web application that displays a portfolio with more information about all my projects, complete with a database backend to store the data on each project.

Dependencies: python3

How to run this project locally:

```shell
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 app.py
```

This will start the development server on port 8000. Use your favorite web browser to navigate to http://localhost:8000 and that's it! Now you can view the portfolio.

## What I've Learned

I've learned so much in my journey. I think some of the highlights are:

1. How frameworks and libraries like SQLAlchemy and Flask make a developer's life easier.
2. What it takes to piece together a fully-operational software product. Hint: Being able to pay attention to the details is critical.
3. How in a professional development environment, tools like git make it possible to scale from a one-person show to a full team of developers working on the same project.

I certainly still have a lot to learn, but those three items were certainly my most valuable lessons from this learning journey.
