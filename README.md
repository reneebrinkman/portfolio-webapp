# portfolio-webapp

This is a web application that displays a portfolio with more information about all my projects, complete with a database backend to store the data on each project.

Dependencies: python3

How to run this project locally:

```shell
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 app.py
```

This will start the development server on port 8000. Use your favorite web browser to navigate to http://localhost:8000 and that's it! Now you can view the portfolio.
